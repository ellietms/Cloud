sql database: RDBS (when we connect it - use : Endpoint in connectivity & security - connect to DB with mysql)
Redshift: (managed data service - holds large volumns of data (big data) - the datas store in column)
S3: is an object storage system in the Cloud.
S3 Glacier: is good for data archiving purposes.(the data we want to access less frequently) 
(DATA ARCHIVING:The practice of identifying data that is no longer active and moving it out of production systems into long-term storage systems )
Cloud Front: is using for caching and speed up the delivery of the content of the website
(we should have our bucket before creating cache though!)
